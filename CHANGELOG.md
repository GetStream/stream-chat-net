### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* The library received many changes in v1.0 to make it easier to use and more maintanable in the future.
The main change is that both [`Channel`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-net/blob/0.26.0/src/stream-chat-net/Channel.cs) and [`Client`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-net/blob/0.26.0/src/stream-chat-net/Client.cs) classes have been separated into small modules that we call clients. (This resambles the [structure of our Java library](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-java/tree/1.5.0/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/java/services) as well.)
Main changes:
- `Channel` and `Client` classes are gone, and have been organized into smaller clients in `StreamChat.Clients` namespace.
- These clients do not maintain state as `Channel` used to did earlier where [it kept the `channelType` and `channelId` in the memory](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-net/blob/0.26.0/src/stream-chat-net/Channel.cs#L34-#L35). So this means that you'll need to pass in `channelType` and `channelId` to a lot of method calls in `IChannelClient`.
- Async method names have `Async` suffix now.
- All public methods and classes have documentation.
- Identifiers has been renamed from `ID` to `Id` to follow [Microsoft's naming guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/capitalization-conventions). Such as `userID` -> `userId`.
- A lot of data classes have been renamed to make more sense. Such as `ChannelObject` -> `Channel`.
- Data classes have been moved to `StreamChat.Models` namespace.
- Full feature parity: all backend APIs are available.
- Returned values are type of `ApiResponse` and expose rate limit informaiton with `GetRateLimit()` method.
- The folder structure of the project has been reorganized to follow [Microsoft's recommendation](https://gist.github.com/davidfowl/ed7564297c61fe9ab814).
- Unit tests have been improved. They are smaller, more focused and have cleanup methods.
- Added .NET 6.0 support.
